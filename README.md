# ROS-core implementation in Rust

This provides a stand-alone implementation of the ROS core. It can be used
in combination with https://github.com/adnanademovic/rosrust to get a single
binary that can publish or subscribe to topics.

## Example

```bash
# start the ros-core
cargo run
```

And run the [python chatter example](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29).
